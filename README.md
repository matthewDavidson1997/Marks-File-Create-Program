## About

Program to automate the generation of marks files.

Creating manually is error-prone and time consuming.

Some reference files have not been included in this repository. 

Due to this, the program will fail unless a dummy file is used. This may be included in a future update.

## Future Updates

- Feature is currently under development to allow the program to gather mark scenario data from excel files
- Feature to find and read QPVs from files
